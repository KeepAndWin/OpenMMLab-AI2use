In this channel, I will recode my learning way of OpenMMLab. As far as I known, OpenMMLab is the most friendly and easiest to learn and widely influential open source algorithm library. In view of the publication of OpenMMLab 2.0, I will show the detail of my usage of mmcv 2.0 mmcls 1.x mmdet 3.x and mmseg 1.x to help reader follow the trend. By the way, co-organizers of this event —— [北京超级云计算中心 (blsc.cn)](https://cloud.blsc.cn/) provides computational support for every-learner. So I may expound my method of it sometime in the presentation.

It is worth mentioning that from this course, I'm going to build some wheels by myself based on the open source algorithm library to assist me in better Multi-Modal research and application. The open source library of NLP algorithm that I'm bullish is hugging face's transformers.
